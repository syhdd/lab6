There are multiple conatiners running in this example, not sure which one is the real container we needed

![ex4.2](ex4.2.png)
Also, not sure about if we need to update this node.js  
I tried to update this in windows, seems like it doesn't change

Later I realized that this is the old version of lab  
However, When I tried the new one

I tried to update, it still goes wrong, maybe because it is windows system...
So I delete the node directory to fixed it, finally
